<h1>Project 1 for Mike Vartanian</h1>

Live URL: http://p1.mikevartanian.me/

Using Bootstrap 3.2.0 Distribution which is located in a separate github directory as I wanted to have the bootstrap code available for other projects. Seems cleaner to have it this way so P2-P4 could potentially use this code without accessing the P1 directory.

Started from a free bootstrap theme called "The Firm" located here, http://bootstrapzero.com/bootstrap-template/the-firm.
