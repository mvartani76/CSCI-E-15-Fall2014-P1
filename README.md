## Details for Teaching Team

Took the challenge of starting from Bootstrap... Separated the .css from the main .php file... Contact form at bottom is non functioning at this time.

Code validates (HTML5 -- a few warnings but no errors) at http://validator.w3.org/

## Outside Code

Using Bootstrap 3.2.0 Distribution which is located in a separate github directory as I wanted to have the bootstrap code available for other projects. Seems cleaner to have it this way so P2-P4 could potentially use this code without accessing the P1 directory.

Started from a free bootstrap theme called "The Firm" located here, http://bootstrapzero.com/bootstrap-template/the-firm.
